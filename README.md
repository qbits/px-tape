# Logs stuff

Simple composable logging library for pixie, provides the building
blocks to make something not too awful (hopefully).

The main idea is to provide
[components](https://github.com/mpenet/component) for appenders,
loggers, layouts and let the user compose them how he likes in his own
logging systems/components. For instance, you can share the same
appender for all levels or not, have multiple appenders for X levels,
different layouts etc, etc. Every component is **very** simple. I can
imagine to provide default systems for common usages down the road and
also a way to generate/load systems from config as data (file, edn,
etc).

Work in progress.
